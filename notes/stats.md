# Notes on stats, upgrades, achievements

Some notes taken to help plan out the data format for a few interrelated features (stats, upgrads, achievements). 

Stats are used to unlock achivements, which in turn unlock upgrades for purchase.

## Stats

Things that track player progress

### businessesOwned (Array)
- bID
- number

### upgrades_owned (Array)
- upgradeID

### moneyEarnedTotal (single)
- number

### moneySpentTotal (single)
- number

### moneyEarnedTime (Array) 
max money earned in a given time period
- periodLength
- money

## Achievements
Show the player a toast when they hit something
- achievmentID (string)
- name (string)
- desc (string)
- criteria (Array), all conditions must eval to true
- hidden (bool) whether or not the acheivement should be viewable before the player hits it

### Criteria
Criteria consist of: statID, targetNum, relationshipID

- Stats: any of the things listed in above
- targetNum: value to hit
- relationshipID: enum (LESS_THAN, GREATER_THAN, LE_EQ, GE_EQ)


## Upgrades
Things that the player can purchase, if they've unlocked them. Rather than duplicate the criteria logic here, will just require that each upgrade have a specific (and singular) achivement unlocked in order to purchase. The only downside there is that each upgrade *must* have an achievement, but not much of a downside since more achivements are generally more fun.

- upgradeID (string)
- name (string)
- desc (string)
- effects (Array)
- cost (number)

### Effects
Effects are limited (for now) to specific effects on a given business type.

- businessID (string)
- effectType (string)
- effectValue (float)

EffectType is one of:

- moneyMult (generally > 1, multiplies the money generated by that business)
- speedMult (generally < 1, multiplies the time required for that business to generate revenue)
- costMult (generally < 1, multiplies the cost of buying a new business of that type)
